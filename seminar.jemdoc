= Algebra Seminar (Autumn 2022/23)

The algebra seminar at IMS covers a wide range of topics related to algebra, including algebraic geometry, number theory and representation theory, etc. Talks usually take place in Room 408 at 3pm (GTM+8) on Thursday afternoons but special arrangements are possible. Everyone is welcome! Please [mailto:zhangziyu@shanghaitech.edu.cn contact me] if you would like to suggest speakers. More information can be found on the [https://ims.shanghaitech.edu.cn/AlgebrawAlgebraicGeometry/list.htm IMS seminar calendar].
