Before that I was a Research Associate at the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](http://www.bath.ac.uk/math-sci) at the [University of Bath](http://www.bath.ac.uk) since 2013, supervised by [Dr. Alastair Craw](http://people.bath.ac.uk/ac886/). I was an [SFB-TR/45](http://www.sfb45.de) PostDoc in Bonn and Mainz from 2009 to 2013, supervised by [Prof. Dr. Daniel Huybrechts](http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/~huybrech/) and [Prof. Dr. Manfred Lehn](http://www.agtz.mathematik.uni-mainz.de/topologie-und-geometrie/prof-dr-manfred-lehn/). I graduated with PhD in Mathematics from Stanford University in 2009, under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Jun Li](http://math.stanford.edu/~jli/).\r\n\r\n### Research\r\nMy research focuses on several aspects in algebraic geometry, including\r\n* moduli spaces of sheaves and complexes on K3 surfaces;\r\n* degeneration of holomorphic symplectic manifolds;\r\n* derived categories, stability conditions and wall-crossing.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\nMy publications and preprints can be found on [MathSciNet](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search/publications.html?pg4=AUCN&s4=Zhang%2C+Ziyu) and [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/find/grp_math/1/au:+Zhang_Ziyu/0/1/0/all/0/1).\r\n* Cohomology jump loci of moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces, (with N.
