### About Me
I recently joined the [Institute of Mathematical Sciences](http://ims.shanghaitech.edu.cn/ims_en/) at [ShanghaiTech University](http://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/) as an Associate Professor. Previously I held research positions at Hannover, Bath, Bonn and Mainz, mentored by [Prof. Dr. Klaus Hulek](http://www.iag.uni-hannover.de/hulek.html), [Dr. Alastair Craw](http://people.bath.ac.uk/ac886/), [Prof. Dr. Daniel Huybrechts](http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/~huybrech/) and [Prof. Dr. Manfred Lehn](http://www.agtz.mathematik.uni-mainz.de/topologie-und-geometrie/prof-dr-manfred-lehn/) respectively. I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from Stanford University under the supervision of [Prof. Jun Li](http://math.stanford.edu/~jli/).

### Research
My research focuses on several aspects in algebraic geometry, including
* moduli spaces of sheaves and complexes on K3 surfaces;
* holomorphic symplectic manifolds and their degenerations;
* derived categories, stability conditions and wall-crossing.

### Publications
My publications and preprints can be found on [zbMATH](https://zbmath.org/?q=ai:zhang.ziyu), [MathSciNet](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search/publications.html?pg4=AUCN&s4=Zhang%2C+Ziyu) and [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/find/grp_math/1/au:+Zhang_Ziyu/0/1/0/all/0/1).
