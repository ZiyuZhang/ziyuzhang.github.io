Title: On the minimum modulus problem in number fields
 
Abstract: In this talk, we will introduce the minimum modulus problem on covering systems. It was posed by Erdős in 1950, who asked whether the minimum modulus of a covering system with distinct moduli is bounded. In 2007, Filaseta, Ford, Konyagin, Pomerance and Yu affirmed it if the reciprocal sum of the moduli of a covering system is bounded. Later in 2015, Hough resolved this problem by showing that the minimum modulus is at most $10^{16}$. In 2022, Balister, Bollobas, Morris, Sahasrabudhe and Tiba reduced this bound to 616,000 by developing a versatile method called the distortion method. Recently, Klein, Koukoulopoulos and Lemieux generalized Hough’s result by using this method. In this talk, we develop the distortion method by introducing the theory of probability measures associated to an inverse system. Following Klein et al.’s work, we derive an analogue of their theorem in the setting of number fields, which provides a solution to Erdős’ minimum modulus problem in number fields. This is a joint work with Huixi Li and Shaoyun Yi.
