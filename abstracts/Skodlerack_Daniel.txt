Title: Choosing beta-extensions for quaternionic forms

Abstract: Beta-extensions are the positive level part for Bushnell-Kutzko-Stevens-types for cuspidal representations for p-adic classical groups. They also play a role in the classification of non-cuspidal representations. But here in opposite to the quasi-split case one needs to be more careful in choosing  a beta-extension for a quaternionic form of a classical group. I will give an overview about beta-extensions and their construction and then present which ones are suitable for quaternionic forms.
